Labyrinthos started from her deciding to illustrate her own deck, the Golden Thread Tarot in 2016. She chose to scrap the instructional booklet, and replace it with an app. Because she is hopelessly stubborn and extremely bad at asking for help, she learned to build mobile apps by coding Golden Thread Tarot herself. At that time, she was still working in various companies as a product designer, where she sometimes used her lunch breaks to give readings.</p>\n<p>Despite what it looks like, Labyrinthos is still run by this lone mysterious headmistress. She does all the illustrations for the decks and app, coding the majority of the app, writing all of our content and articles, social media, and customer service. And yes, she is really very tired all time. Phew.</p>\n<p>Her husband Luis occasionally devotes weekends to helping her code the back end of this app, since unlike Tina, he is an actual engineer and not just a designer pretending to be an engineer. Yay! Thanks Luis!</p>\n<p>The two of them live with their cat Mephisto and their plants in Queens, New York.</p>\n<p>We have never gotten any outside investment, and don't plan on it.   We're a proud mom and pop (and cat) shop! We don't make a penny off the app, and we intend to keep it a free resource, with zero clunky advertisements. Keeping it running isn't easy or free though, and we have to pay for data storage, upkeep and more that comes out of our household budget. If you enjoy this app, please consider supporting us by buying one of Tina's printed tarot decks!</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy working with the tarot as much as we do.</p>"

It can very well mean taking a trip of some kind to a far off place, but it can also signify the mental state of travel - the desire to see new places, to explore and to voyage into the unknown. Regardless of whether you are actually, physically making a journey, this card signals heading out on an adventure of some sort - where you are going far from what is familiar. This card can also imply distance to its surrounding cards, sometimes concerning long-distance relationships, far away family, or an overseas business trip - depending on your question and the other cards in the spread. This definition too, can also be more metaphorical in nature. While you may be in close proximity physically to something, you may not feel close to it.

This same sense of belonging and comfort, while creating stability and security - can also make it difficult to go forth and try new ways of doing things. The house is a boundary between what is outside and what is inside - it is a bubble or a barrier, something which separates. It implies that there is an “us” and a “them”.

Another facet of the snake can involve deception - to be specific, the kind of deception that is calculating and self serving, almost manipulative.  Another interpretation of the Snake card in Lenormand that is rarely used, but just as important, is its wisdom and knowledge. While in more traditional interpretations, such as the ones above, it has been plastered with morality, there is a more pure reading of the snake that has none of those value judgements.

			"description": "A cunning trickster, the fox has been traditionally known to farmers as a thief that steals their hard earned crop. For that reason, some of the more common meanings to the fox include deception by a cunning and shrewd creature. But we can also understand the fox as a creature that engages in that kind of behavior in order to adapt and survive. Sometimes, in order to make ends meet, we have to engage in egotistical and selfish behavior. Self-care is sometimes interpreted by others as selfishness. The methods they use may certainly not be honest or fair, but those may be the only means available to them. The intelligence of the Fox can also translate to not just sneaky behavior, but also suspicion and distrust. They tread lightly on their environments, aware of all the danger that may be lurking. This too, is a survival instinct.",

The power that Bear Lenormand card wields can either be used for positive reasons, such as when a mother bear is protective of her cubs, or for selfish reasons. In the best of light, the bear can represent a leader, one that both nurtures and teaches, guiding those in their care towards a better future. In this case, the Bear can represent someone that truly cares and is invested in your future. Other times, the Bear card can represent people, that despite the best intentions, may be trying to assert themselves over our own decisions.

This card represents both the journey towards those visions, and the dream itself.

The Stork is known as a bird with long migratory patterns, sometimes traveling between seasons between the southernmost tip of Africa to Europe. Sometimes, this migration can be literal - you may be going through a geographical relocation. But more often, it can be a figurative movement - where you are going through a process where you are redefining certain aspects of yourself. Usually, this is something that starts from within; like the a change in the way you define love, or your own identity. This tends to shape the actions you take and how you make choices. The inward change radiates outward, and it is most times, a very slow process. To understand where in life you’re changing, you’ll have to take a look at the surrounding cards. Finally, since migratory patterns are seasonal, the Stork card can also indicate cycles and returns. That means you can find yourself in recurring situations or feelings.",

There is a sense of impenetrability to these institutions, a feeling that they are quite removed from the average person, and it’s inner workings are hidden and mysterious. As someone from inside the tower, we understand that we must sometimes protect ourselves - and towers were used as fortresses to defend against  incoming attacks.

There is a genuine and heartfelt connection here. Sometimes though, our infatuations get the best of us, and our love of someone or something may make it difficult for us to see their flaws. We can start believing what we want to believe about them. So while this card generally can be positive, we must also ask ourselves whether we are not seeing the whole picture here.

				"You see, if you’ve been studying, you’ll know that each tarot card represents an archetype, or a symbol that exists within all of us. ✨ Here, on the astral plane, they’re not just cards. They’re actually keys of a sort. ",
				"Well, to yourself, kinda. 🧐 You may have noticed that each time you level up, you unlock a new avatar, one that corresponds to a Major Arcana tarot card.",
				"Have you been paying attention? 😡 Can I fire you as a student?! Check your profile tab! There’s a total of 22 avatars you can transform into.",
				"Well, each of those cards, or archetypes, or keys - has existed inside you all along, just like it exists in all human beings, as well as the divine being itself. Do you see what I’m getting at here? 🤓",
				"Each tarot card you unlock awakens a little fragment of yourself that you forgot long ago! 🌈 You were once a Fool, a Magician, a Hermit; you were once each of the tarot cards. All those memories that you lost? They’re all there, see! So they’re the key to you getting home!",
				"Well, we’ll still be here. 🤔 It’ll be a little lonely, perhaps a bit drab. Ideally you’d send snacks, 🍕 I love snacks! 🍰But you’d go back with your memories of this place too, and maybe you can remind other humans that we’re here, waiting for them to return. And waiting for snacks. 🍟🍪🍩🍗",
				"Maybe eventually with everyone helping, the divine being will awaken once again too! 😬",
				"🚀 You just shoot them with a rocket launcher into space, and we eventually find them. It takes forever, but we’re immortal so it’s fine.",

				"Hmm, well, that’s a little hard to explain. 😮 This is the space between realms, kind of like the place you go when you're dreaming. It’s a bridge between physical worlds. ✨ Everyone that comes here, whether they’re human, lizard, elf, goblin or whatever comes here in the same form - a specter, much like yourself. 👻 Sadly, it’s been rather empty here lately.",
				"Yes, I suppose that is a bit odd. The only spirits I’ve met that have ever forgotten were those that had lost the connection to their bodies, and…well, to their selves. 😣",

				"Well, funny thing - you were all created with a wonderful sense of curiosity, desire and imagination, a mirror of the divine being. Eventually you wandered too far, and weren’t able to come back home! It’s not your fault really. Just kids being kids.",
				"Oh us? As a last ditch attempt, the divine being summoned us with the remainder of the magic it had left. When we were awakened, the divine being was already asleep, but it left us a mission.",
				"Written on a sacred post it note plastered on its forehead, was something something about getting you mortals back home.",
				"It worked for a while; some of us monsters, gods and goddesses helped you hear the music of the stars that guided you back to the divine being. Sometimes we scared you, sometimes we inspired you, each in our own way. 💜",
				"But eventually you couldn’t hear us either. 😢 Lots of us gave up. Most of us are sleeping now too.",
				"Yep! I’ve been waiting for one particular mortal spirit. Doppelgängers are rather strange, you see - we’re shadow spirits, meaning that we’re assigned to one mortal each.",

Despite the element of earth within her, she can be rather impractical, but also talented in manifesting her emotions and channeling them into artistic endeavors.

His moods are fickle, he can be easily excited, but also easily bored. His contradictions mean that his attempts at taking action are hasty, and can mean mistakes that lead him to trouble.

The swords are a suit that loves to cut through the darkness in order to reveal what lies beneath. Illusions are ripped away, leaving nothing but a bare and sometimes ugly reality. Hard lessons are learned with this card, but they are not for nothing.",

However, this was not done without sacrifice. Overtime, it's taken a toll and you are perhaps feeling tired, and not as confident as you were before.

They represent people and personality types rather than situations or events and they can be difficult to understand without a strong understanding of the elements and the four suits. \n<br><br>\nThe court cards are divided into four ranks: Pages, Knights, Queens, and Kings. Each rank has its own unique qualities and meanings.  Pages are the children of their suit, while knights are the teenagers. Queens often are thought of as caregivers while kings are considered leaders. Remember that any of these personality traits can apply to any gender, despite the archaic naming conventions.\n<br><br>\nWith that in mind,  think of the suit of the court card as their focus; where in life they are most concerned with. Their rank then dictates how they interact with that aspect of life.  ",

			"content": "While traditionally tarot has been used for divination, a method to 'look into the future', our approach to tarot is a bit different. Our belief is that tarot is best used as a tool to allow the hidden voice of the self to speak. The cards are simply something tangible on which we can project our feelings and thoughts.<br><br>\nThe symbols in the tarot are pulled from a deep history of human myth and archetypes, part of the world that psychologist Carl Gustav Jung would call the collective unconscious. Through telling and retelling, these archetypes have become embedded in the way that we interpret stories. Tarot allows us to put them together in various configurations so that we can see parallels between the stories within the cards and our own experiences.<br><br>\nThe story you tell about yourself greatly influences the way you think about your future. Tarot is about helping you tell your story, finding facets you might have missed.<br><br>\nObviously, this has limits, because <i>we</i> have limits. But the cards are often enough to provide a framework for you to begin the process of self-introspection and examine which aspects of your beliefs, attitudes and ideologies could do with some tweaking.",

What it means is roughly this: earth mirrors heaven, man mirrors god, the macrocosm mirrors the microcosm. 'The world' is simply a mirror of our own inner worlds. The boundary between these two is arbitrary - and self and other are really just one.<br><br>\nIf you understand yourself and your reality deeply, all paths of action will be clear. Hence the usefulness of the stories the tarot helps you tell! Magic becomes simply understanding what each symbol does in relationship to the others and the world, and interacting with them. This meaning of magic teaches us that once we shed our inner light on the story reality is telling, we can see all parts at play, and transform it.<br><br>\nSo go tell yourself some stories, and re-write them the way you want them to be told.",
